# code-greekifier

A friend showed me a meme depicting a semicolon (;) and an identical Greek question mark (;), which inspired me to make this cursed project.

The project is finally completed, and I couldn't be prouder. I've learned quite a bit about Python's os module and (especially) how to use Git and Github in general, as this is my first Github repository.

Feel free to provide feedback!

(Recently discovered that Greek question marks so greatly resemble semicolons that their code point will decompose into that of a semicolon, so it may not always work!)

## To Do:

- Other user-friendly changes, i.e. nicer UI
- Turn the code Greekifier into a downloadable Python package
- Testing for bugs
